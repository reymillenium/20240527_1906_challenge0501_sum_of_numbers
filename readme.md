# COP 1334 Assignment - Introduction to C++

## Chapter 5: Challenge 1

## Title: Sum of Numbers

### Exercise Description:

Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program should use a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example, if the user enters 50, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, . . ., 50.

_Input Validation: Do not accept a negative starting number._

## Execution from the Terminal (Alternative way without an IDE):

We must provide to the Compiler the same switches that we usually do in the IDE:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp
```

That will create a file named 'a.out' if you are working in MacOS or a .exe file if you are on Windows. That's the default executable file's name when we don't provide a name.

But we can also specify the name of the resulting executable file:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp -o your_prefered_executable_file_name
```

And in order to run that a.out file, we must execute on the terminal:

```terminal
 % ./a.out
```

## Result of Execution on the Terminal (MacOS example):

```terminal
reinier@reinier % ./your_prefered_executable_file_name
Enter a positive integer value: 1234
The sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered (1,234) is: 761,995

Process finished with exit code 0
reinier@reinier % 
```
